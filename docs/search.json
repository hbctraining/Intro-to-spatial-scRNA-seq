ADD DESCRIPTION HERE STILL Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the Introduction to R workshop.\nNote for Trainers: Please note that the schedule linked below assumes that learners will spend between 3-4 hours on reading through, and completing exercises from selected lessons between classes. The online component of the workshop focuses on more exercises and discussion/Q & A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nLO 1\nLO 2\nLO 3\nLO 4\n\n\n\nLessons\n\nWorkshop schedule (trainer-led learning)\nSelf-learning\n\n\n\nInstallation Requirements\n\nApplications\nDownload the most recent versions of R and RStudio for your laptop:\n\nR (version 4.0.0 or above)\nRStudio\n\n\n\nPackages for R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nNote 1: Install the packages in the order listed below.\nNote 2: All the package names listed below are case sensitive!\nNote 3: If you have a Mac with an M1 chip, download and install this tool before intalling your packages: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg\nNote 4: At any point (especially if you’ve used R/Bioconductor in the past), in the console R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:. If you see this, type “a” at the prompt and hit Enter to update any old packages. Updating packages can sometimes take quite a bit of time to run, so please account for that before you start with these installations.\nNote 5: If you see a message in your console along the lines of “binary version available but the source version is later”, followed by a question, “Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? y/n”, type n for no, and hit enter.\n\n\n(1) Install the X packages listed below from Bioconductor using the the BiocManager::install() function.\n\npackage_1\npackage_2\npackage_3\npackage_4\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\nBiocManager::install(\"package_1\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_2\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_3\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_4\")\n\n(2) Install the Y packages listed below from CRAN using the install.packages() function.\n\npackage_5\npackage_6\npackage_7\npackage_8\npackage_9\npackage_10\npackage_11\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\ninstall.packages(\"package_5\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_6\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_7\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_8\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_9\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_10\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_11\")\n\n(3) Finally, please check that all the packages were installed successfully by loading them one at a time using the library() function.\n\nlibrary(package_1)\nlibrary(package_2)\nlibrary(package_3)\nlibrary(package_4)\nlibrary(package_5)\nlibrary(package_6)\nlibrary(package_7)\nlibrary(package_8)\nlibrary(package_9)\nlibrary(package_10)\nlibrary(package_11)\n\n(4) Once all packages have been loaded, run sessionInfo().\n\nsessionInfo()\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nTo cite material from this course in your publications, please use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nCreate Zenodo citation\n\n\nA lot of time and effort went into the preparation of these materials. Citations help us understand the needs of the community, gain recognition for our work, and attract further funding to support our teaching activities. Thank you for citing this material if it helped you in your data analysis."

Translate the points from their raw expression coordinates to coordinates centered around the center of the data\nNext, we need to shift the points so that the center of the data corresponds to the origin.

The input needed for this function comes from the output generated by SpaceRanger, including both the feature matrix and low-resolution tissue image.

    "text": "Anatomy of a Seurat Object\nAs we can see from our Seurat callout, there are a lot of different parts inside our object. Here, we will go through each of the major components of a Seurat object and how you would access certain pieces of information.\n\nAssaysFeatures and CellsLayersSpatial fieldMetadata\n\n\nAssays are where we can store different counts matrices - we are not forced to keep the same features and variable genes across assays. Each assay will contain it’s own Layers that can be distinct from other assays in the object. This is useful in several different instances:\n\nMulti-modal assays, where you can keep the expression matrices for RNA, ATAC, or protein in a single Seurat object\nStoring counts matrices from a variety of different normalization techniques\nBatch integration methods will sometimes generate a transformed counts matrix\n\nHere we can print the different assays that exist within our crc object:\n\nAssays(crc)\n\n[1] \"Spatial.008um\" \"Spatial.016um\"\n\n\nWe have to separate assays for the different bin sizes, which makes sense because we have different count matrices for our cells based upon the bin size that was selected.\nThe DefaultAssay() function shows us which assay information will be used in other Seurat function calls, unless explicitly stated specific otherwise.\n\nDefaultAssay(crc)\n\n[1] \"Spatial.008um\"\n\n\nWe can also change what our default assay is. Let’s set it to the 016um bins:\n\nDefaultAssay(crc) &lt;- \"Spatial.016um\"\ncrc\n\nAn object of class Seurat \n36170 features across 678003 samples within 2 assays \nActive assay: Spatial.016um (18085 features, 0 variable features)\n 1 layer present: counts\n 1 other assay present: Spatial.008um\n 2 spatial fields of view present: P5CRC.008um P5CRC.016um\n\n\nNow we see that the callout says: Active assay: Spatial.016um\n\n\nOur count matrices function as any other matrix does, with rows and columns.\nIn Seurat, the rows correspond to Features. In the case of spatial transcriptomics, our features are genes. In other experiments, features could refer to chromatin peaks or protein. Since our features are not always genes, we will see the term Feature appear in Seurat function later. The important thing to recall is that in this Visium HD dataset, we are quantifying RNA expression (genes).\nWe can see what the first few genes in our count matrix are:\n\nFeatures(crc) %&gt;% head()\n\n[1] \"SAMD11\"  \"NOC2L\"   \"KLHL17\"  \"PLEKHN1\" \"PERM1\"   \"HES4\"   \n\n\nAs well as see the number of genes that are found in each of our assays:\n\nnrow(crc[[\"Spatial.008um\"]])\n\n[1] 18085\n\nnrow(crc[[\"Spatial.016um\"]])\n\n[1] 18085\n\n\nIn Seurat, the rows correspond to Cells (or samples as it appears in the callout).\nWe can see what the first few cells in our count matrix are:\n\nCells(crc) %&gt;% head()\n\n[1] \"s_016um_00052_00082-1\" \"s_016um_00396_00063-1\" \"s_016um_00297_00147-1\"\n[4] \"s_016um_00347_00254-1\" \"s_016um_00299_00088-1\" \"s_016um_00050_00315-1\"\n\n\nAs well as see the number of cells that are found in each of our assays:\n\nncol(crc[[\"Spatial.008um\"]])\n\n[1] 541968\n\nncol(crc[[\"Spatial.016um\"]])\n\n[1] 136035\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBin size\n\n\n\nDid you notice that the number of cells is different between our 8um and 16um bins?\nThis is why the bin value matters, it determines how many “cells” are ultimately generated. Where a smaller bin size results in more spots.\n\n\n\n\nLayers are our count matrices.\n\nLayers(crc)\n\n[1] \"counts\"\n\n\nBy default, Seurat uses the following naming convention for the counts matrices within an Assay:\n\n\n\nLayer\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncounts\nRaw counts\n\n\ndata\nNormalized counts\n\n\nscale.data\nScaled‑normalized counts\n\n\n\nYou may notice that our Seurat object only contains counts right now. This is because we have not run any normalization steps yet (we will discuss how to do so in future lessons).\nUsing the LayerData() function we can access the entire counts matrix. Furthermore, we can specify the assay if we would prefer to not use the DefaultAssay.\n\nLayerData(crc, \n          assay = \"Spatial.016um\", \n          layer = \"count\")[1:5, 1:5]\n\n5 x 5 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n        s_016um_00052_00082-1 s_016um_00396_00063-1 s_016um_00297_00147-1\nSAMD11                      .                     .                     .\nNOC2L                       1                     1                     .\nKLHL17                      .                     .                     .\nPLEKHN1                     .                     .                     .\nPERM1                       .                     .                     .\n        s_016um_00347_00254-1 s_016um_00299_00088-1\nSAMD11                      .                     .\nNOC2L                       .                     .\nKLHL17                      .                     .\nPLEKHN1                     .                     .\nPERM1                       .                     .\n\n\nBy printing the first 5 features and cells in our object (for easier visualization). We can see that we are working with whole numbers which reinforces the idea that this is the raw data, with no tranformations having been applied.\n\n\nWe do not just have expression data associated with our sample, we also have the spatial slide that comes with its own set of values and information.\nFor example we can grab the x,y coordinates of each spot using the GetTissueCoordinates() function.\n\nGetTissueCoordinates(crc) %&gt;% head()\n\n                             x        y                  cell\ns_016um_00052_00082-1 60930.62 49099.34 s_016um_00052_00082-1\ns_016um_00396_00063-1 40823.45 48072.16 s_016um_00396_00063-1\ns_016um_00297_00147-1 46628.74 52957.09 s_016um_00297_00147-1\ns_016um_00347_00254-1 43732.54 59222.16 s_016um_00347_00254-1\ns_016um_00299_00088-1 46497.72 49509.67 s_016um_00299_00088-1\ns_016um_00050_00315-1 61103.62 62715.76 s_016um_00050_00315-1\n\n\nOr visualize what our slide looks like:\n\nSpatialDimPlot(crc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeurat automatically creates some metadata for each of the cells when the object is created.

    "text": "Using a for Loop\nIn practice, you will likely have several samples that you will need to read in data for, and that can get tedious and error-prone if you do it one at a time. So, to make the data import into R more efficient we can use a for loop, which will iterate over a series of commands for each of the inputs given and create Seurat objects for each of our samples.\nIn R, the for loop has the following structure/syntax:\n\n## DO NOT RUN\n\nfor (variable in input){\n    command1\n    command2\n    command3\n}\n\nToday we will use it to iterate over the two sample folders and execute commands for each sample as we did above for a single sample:\n\nCreate the Seurat objects from the SpaceRanger data (Load10X_Spatial())\nSet orig.ident to be our sample\n\nOnce those steps run, we will store the newly generated Seurat object to a list called list_seurat so that we can eventually merge both samples together.\nWe will be using a bin size of 8um for the remainder of this workshop\n\nsamples &lt;- c(\"P5CRC\", \"P5NAT\")\nlist_seurat &lt;- list()\n\nfor (sample in samples) {\n  \n  # Path to data directory\n  data_dir &lt;- paste0(\"data/\", sample)\n  # Create seurat object and set orig ident to be sample\n  seurat &lt;- Load10X_Spatial(data.dir = data_dir,\n                            bin.size = c(8),\n                            slice = sample)\n  seurat$orig.ident &lt;- sample\n  \n  # Store seurat object in our list\n  list_seurat[[sample]] &lt;- seurat\n}\n\nTo confirm that we succesfully loaded both samples in, we can take a look at the contents of list_seurat.\n\nlist_seurat\n\n$P5CRC\nAn object of class Seurat \n18085 features across 541968 samples within 1 assay \nActive assay: Spatial.008um (18085 features, 0 variable features)\n 1 layer present: counts\n 1 spatial field of view present: P5CRC.008um\n\n$P5NAT\nAn object of class Seurat \n18085 features across 435773 samples within 1 assay \nActive assay: Spatial.008um (18085 features, 0 variable features)\n 1 layer present: counts\n 1 spatial field of view present: P5NAT.008um\n\n\nNow that we have created both of these objects, let’s take a quick look at the list we just created. We should see that there are two Seurat objects in our list that correspond to each sample. This is exactly what we had hoped to see, so now we can move on to the next step which is merging the sample together int oa singular Seurat object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging, not Integration\n\n\n\n\n\nA common point of confusion is the distinction between integration and merging. In the field, integration is considered to be modifying either your counts or latent space in a way to correct for a batch variable. Whereas what we are doing now is merging or concatenating multiple samples together. This process of merging does not transform the values in the count matrices.",

    "text": "Why Should We Normalize?\nAn essential first step in the majority of mRNA expression analyses is normalization, whereby systematic variations are adjusted for to make expression counts comparable across genes and/or samples. The counts of mapped reads for each gene is proportional to the expression of RNA (“interesting”) in addition to many other factors (“uninteresting”). Normalization is the process of adjusting raw count values to account for the “uninteresting” factors.\nThe main factors often considered during normalization are:\nSequencing depth: Accounting for sequencing depth is necessary for comparison of gene expression between cells. In the example below, each gene appears to have doubled in expression in cell 2, however this is a consequence of cell 2 having twice the sequencing depth."

    "section": "Log-normalization Steps",
    "text": "Log-normalization Steps\nVarious methods have been developed specifically for scRNA-seq normalization. Some simpler methods resemble what we have seen with bulk RNA-seq; the application of global scale factors** adjusting for a count-depth relationship that is assumed common across all genes. However, if those assumptions are not true then this basic normalization can lead to over-correction for lowly and moderately expressed genes and, in some cases, under-normalization of highly expressed genes (Bacher R et al, 2017). More complex methods will apply correction on a per-gene basis. In this lesson we will explore both approaches.\nRegardless of which method is used for normalization, it can be helpful to think of it as a two-step process (even though it is often described as a single step in most papers). The first is a scaling step and the second is a transformation.\n1. Scaling\nThe first step in normalization is to multiply each UMI count by a cell specific factor to get all cells to have the same UMI counts. Why would we want to do this? Different cells have different amounts of mRNA; this could be due to differences between cell types or variation within the same cell type depending on how well the chemistry worked in one drop versus another. In either case, we are not interested in comparing these absolute counts between cells. Instead we are interested in comparing concentrations, and scaling helps achieve this.\n2. Transformation\nThe next step is a transformation, and it is at this step where we can distinguish the simpler versus complex methods as mentioned above.\nSimple transformations are those which apply the same function to each individual measurement. Common examples include a log transform (which is applied in the original Seurat workflow), or a square root transform (less commonly used)."

We also strongly encourage you to explore the video StatQuest’s video for a more thorough understanding.\n\n\n\nLet’s say you are working with a single-cell RNA-seq dataset with 12,000 cells and you have quantified the expression of 20,000 genes. The schematic below demonstrates how you would go from a cell x gene matrix to principal component (PC) scores for each individual cell.\n\nTo perform PCA, we need to first choose the most variable features, then scale the data. Since highly expressed genes exhibit the highest amount of variation and we don’t want our ‘highly variable genes’ only to reflect high expression, we need to scale the data to scale variation with expression level. The Seurat ScaleData() function will scale the data by:\n\nAdjusting the expression of each gene to give a mean expression across cells to be 0\nScaling expression of each gene to give a variance across cells to be 1\n\n\n# Scale the data counts\nseurat_processed &lt;- ScaleData(seurat_processed)\nseurat_processed\n\nAn object of class Seurat \n36170 features across 826613 samples within 2 assays \nActive assay: sketch (18085 features, 2000 variable features)\n 3 layers present: counts, data, scale.data\n 1 other assay present: Spatial.008um\n 2 spatial fields of view present: P5CRC.008um P5NAT.008um\n\n\nWe have calculated a new layer titled sale.data, where our scaled log-normalized counts now exist. So now we can proceed in calculating our Principal Components with RunPCA().\n\n# Run PCA\nseurat_processed &lt;- RunPCA(seurat_processed,\n                           assay = \"sketch\",\n                           reduction.name = \"pca.sketch\")\n\nThe information printed out show the top genes that influence a cell’s score for each component. This includes genes that have both a positive and negative weight.\nIf we look at our updated seurat_processed object:\n\nseurat_processed\n\nAn object of class Seurat \n36170 features across 826613 samples within 2 assays \nActive assay: sketch (18085 features, 2000 variable features)\n 3 layers present: counts, data, scale.data\n 1 other assay present: Spatial.008um\n 1 dimensional reduction calculated: pca.sketch\n 2 spatial fields of view present: P5CRC.008um P5NAT.008um\n\n\nWe see that we have stored our PCA results: dimensional reduction calculated: pca.sketch"

    "text": "Visualize PCA\nAfter the PC scores have been calculated, you are looking at a matrix of 12,000 x 12,000 that represents the information about relative gene expression in all the cells. You can select the PC1 and PC2 columns and plot that in a 2D way.\n\n\nDimPlot(seurat_processed,\n        reduction = \"pca.sketch\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately what we have calculated with PCA are values that can represent how similar cells are to one another. We would expect that cells with similar gene expression will have similar PC values. For example, we would anticipate that two Fibroblast cells would have comparable gene expression - which would also results in similar scores in principal components. This is why many of the downstream steps in the remainder of this lesson use PCA as the input."

    "text": "Selecting PC Dimensions\nTo overcome the extensive technical noise in the expression of any single gene for scRNA-seq data, Seurat assigns cells to clusters based on their PCA scores derived from the expression of the integrated most variable genes. Each PC essentially representing a “metagene” that combines information across a correlated gene set. Determining how many PCs to include in the clustering step is therefore important to ensure that we are capturing the majority of the variation, or cell types, present in our dataset.\nIt is useful to explore the PCs prior to deciding which PCs to include for the downstream clustering analysis.\nThe elbow plot is a helpful way to determine how many PCs to use for clustering so that we are capturing majority of the variation in the data. The elbow plot visualizes the standard deviation of each PC, and we are looking for where the standard deviations begins to plateau. Essentially, where the elbow appears is usually the threshold for identifying the majority of the variation. However, this method can be quite subjective.\nLet’s draw an elbow plot using the top 50 PCs:\n\n# Plot the elbow plot\nElbowPlot(object = seurat_processed,\n          reduction = \"pca.sketch\",\n          ndims = 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this plot, we could roughly determine the majority of the variation by where the elbow occurs around PC8 - PC10, or one could argue that it should be when the data points start to get close to the X-axis, PC30 or so. This gives us a very rough idea of the number of PCs needed to be included.\nWe will be using 50 PCs for our downstream steps."

    "text": "Clustering\nNext, Seurat will iteratively group cells together with the goal of optimizing the standard modularity function.\nWe will use the FindClusters() function to perform the graph-based clustering. The resolution is an important argument that sets the “granularity” of the downstream clustering and will need to be optimized for every individual experiment. For datasets of 3,000 - 5,000 cells, the resolution set between 0.4-1.4 generally yields good clustering. Increased resolution values lead to a greater number of clusters, which is often required for larger datasets.\nThe FindClusters() function allows us to enter a series of resolutions and will calculate the “granularity” of the clustering. This is very helpful for testing which resolution works for moving forward without having to run the function for each resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting different resolution values\n\n\n\nTypically we would recommend using a variety of different resolutions and select a resolution that best suits your dataset.

The most popular methods include t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) techniques.\nBoth methods aim to place cells with similar local neighborhoods in high-dimensional space together in low-dimensional space. These methods will require you to input number of PCA dimentions to use for the visualization, we suggest using the same number of PCs as input to the clustering analysis. Here, we will proceed with the UMAP method for visualizing the clusters.\n\nseurat_processed &lt;- RunUMAP(seurat_processed, \n                            reduction = \"pca.sketch\", \n                            reduction.name = \"umap.sketch\", \n                            return.model = T, dims = 1:50)\nseurat_processed\n\nAn object of class Seurat \n36170 features across 826613 samples within 2 assays \nActive assay: sketch (18085 features, 2000 variable features)\n 3 layers present: counts, data, scale.data\n 1 other assay present: Spatial.008um\n 2 dimensional reductions calculated: pca.sketch, umap.sketch\n 2 spatial fields of view present: P5CRC.008um P5NAT.008um\n\n\nThese UMAP coordinates are now stored in the dimensional reductions calculated: pca.sketch, umap.sketch\nWhich we can now visualize with the clusters that we calculated earlier using DimPlot() and adding clearer labels withLabelClusters()`.\n\n# Plot UMAP\np &lt;- DimPlot(seurat_processed, \n        reduction = \"umap.sketch\", label = T) + \n  ggtitle(\"Sketched clustering\")\nLabelClusters(p, id = \"ident\",  fontface = \"bold\", size = 5, \n              bg.colour = \"white\", bg.r = .2, force = 0)"
