ADD DESCRIPTION HERE STILL Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the Introduction to R workshop.\nNote for Trainers: Please note that the schedule linked below assumes that learners will spend between 3-4 hours on reading through, and completing exercises from selected lessons between classes. The online component of the workshop focuses on more exercises and discussion/Q & A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nLO 1\nLO 2\nLO 3\nLO 4\n\n\n\nLessons\n\nWorkshop schedule (trainer-led learning)\nSelf-learning\n\n\n\nInstallation Requirements\n\nApplications\nDownload the most recent versions of R and RStudio for your laptop:\n\nR (version 4.0.0 or above)\nRStudio\n\n\n\nPackages for R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nNote 1: Install the packages in the order listed below.\nNote 2: All the package names listed below are case sensitive!\nNote 3: If you have a Mac with an M1 chip, download and install this tool before intalling your packages: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg\nNote 4: At any point (especially if you’ve used R/Bioconductor in the past), in the console R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:. If you see this, type “a” at the prompt and hit Enter to update any old packages. Updating packages can sometimes take quite a bit of time to run, so please account for that before you start with these installations.\nNote 5: If you see a message in your console along the lines of “binary version available but the source version is later”, followed by a question, “Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? y/n”, type n for no, and hit enter.\n\n\n(1) Install the X packages listed below from Bioconductor using the the BiocManager::install() function.\n\npackage_1\npackage_2\npackage_3\npackage_4\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\nBiocManager::install(\"package_1\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_2\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_3\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_4\")\n\n(2) Install the Y packages listed below from CRAN using the install.packages() function.\n\npackage_5\npackage_6\npackage_7\npackage_8\npackage_9\npackage_10\npackage_11\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\ninstall.packages(\"package_5\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_6\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_7\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_8\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_9\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_10\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_11\")\n\n(3) Finally, please check that all the packages were installed successfully by loading them one at a time using the library() function.\n\nlibrary(package_1)\nlibrary(package_2)\nlibrary(package_3)\nlibrary(package_4)\nlibrary(package_5)\nlibrary(package_6)\nlibrary(package_7)\nlibrary(package_8)\nlibrary(package_9)\nlibrary(package_10)\nlibrary(package_11)\n\n(4) Once all packages have been loaded, run sessionInfo().\n\nsessionInfo()\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nTo cite material from this course in your publications, please use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nCreate Zenodo citation\n\n\nA lot of time and effort went into the preparation of these materials. Citations help us understand the needs of the community, gain recognition for our work, and attract further funding to support our teaching activities. Thank you for citing this material if it helped you in your data analysis."

Translate the points from their raw expression coordinates to coordinates centered around the center of the data\nNext, we need to shift the points so that the center of the data corresponds to the origin.

The input needed for this function comes from the output generated by SpaceRanger, including both the feature matrix and low-resolution tissue image. Once supplied, a Seurat object with both gene-level counts and spatial information is created. There are 3 main arguments that we will be utilizing for this step:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndata.dir\nDirectory containing the H5 file specified by filename and the image data in a subdirectory called spatial\n\n\nbin.size\nSpecifies the bin sizes to read in (defaults to c(16, 8))\n\n\nslice\nName for the stored image of the tissue slice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing ? to look up function arguments\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are ever unsure what parameters you can supply to a function, you make use of the ? call in R.

In particular, let us take a look at sample data/P5CRC which is the path would supply as data.dir in the Load10X_Spatial() function.\n\n\ndata/P5CRC/\n├── Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer_P5_binned_outputs.tar.gz\n├── Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer_P5_spatial.tar.gz\n├── binned_outputs\n│   ├── square_002um\n│   ├── square_008um\n│   └── square_016um\n└── spatial\n    ├── aligned_fiducials.jpg\n    ├── aligned_tissue_image.jpg\n    ├── cytassist_image.tiff\n    ├── detected_tissue_image.jpg\n    ├── tissue_hires_image.png\n    └── tissue_lowres_image.png\n\n\nIn the Visium HD assay, in addition to providing data at the level of the 2µm x 2µm squares, SpaceRanger also bins the 2µm x 2µm squares into 8µm x 8µm and 16µm x 16µm bins. We can see each of these different resolution inside the binned_outputs folder.

    "text": "Anatomy of a Seurat Object\nAs we can see from our Seurat callout, there are a lot of different parts inside our object. Here, we will go through each of the major components of a Seurat object and how you would access important pieces of information.\n\nAssaysLayersFeatures and CellsSpatial fieldMetadata\n\n\nAssays are where we can store different counts matrices - we are not forced to keep the same features and variable genes across assays. Each assay will contain it’s own Layers that can be distinct from other assays in the object. This is useful in several different instances:\n\nMulti-modal assays, where you can keep the expression matrices for RNA, ATAC, or protein in a single Seurat object\nStoring counts matrices from a variety of different normalization techniques\nBatch integration methods will sometimes generate a transformed counts matrix\n\nHere we can print the different assays that exist within our crc object:\n\nAssays(crc)\n\n[1] \"Spatial.008um\" \"Spatial.016um\"\n\n\nWe have to separate assays for the different bin sizes, which makes sense because we have different count matrices for our cells based upon the bin size that was selected.\nThe DefaultAssay() function shows us which assay information will be used in other Seurat function calls, unless explicitly stated specific otherwise.\n\nDefaultAssay(crc)\n\n[1] \"Spatial.008um\"\n\n\nWe can also change what our default assay is. Let’s set it to the 016um bins:\n\nDefaultAssay(crc) &lt;- \"Spatial.016um\"\ncrc\n\nAn object of class Seurat \n36170 features across 678003 samples within 2 assays \nActive assay: Spatial.016um (18085 features, 0 variable features)\n 1 layer present: counts\n 1 other assay present: Spatial.008um\n 2 spatial fields of view present: P5CRC.008um P5CRC.016um\n\n\nNow we see that the callout says: Active assay: Spatial.016um\n\n\nLayers are our count matrices.\n\nLayers(crc)\n\n[1] \"counts\"\n\n\nBy default, Seurat uses the following naming convention for the counts matrices within an Assay:\n\n\n\nLayer\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncounts\nRaw counts\n\n\ndata\nNormalized counts\n\n\nscale.data\nScaled‑normalized counts\n\n\n\nYou may notice that our Seurat object only contains counts right now. This is because we have not run any normalization steps yet (we will discuss how to do so in future lessons).\nUsing the LayerData() function we can access the entire counts matrix. Furthermore, we can specify the assay if we would prefer to not use the DefaultAssay.\n\nLayerData(crc, \n          assay = \"Spatial.016um\", \n          layer = \"count\")[1:5, 1:5]\n\n5 x 5 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n        s_016um_00052_00082-1 s_016um_00396_00063-1 s_016um_00297_00147-1\nSAMD11                      .                     .                     .\nNOC2L                       1                     1                     .\nKLHL17                      .                     .                     .\nPLEKHN1                     .                     .                     .\nPERM1                       .                     .                     .\n        s_016um_00347_00254-1 s_016um_00299_00088-1\nSAMD11                      .                     .\nNOC2L                       .                     .\nKLHL17                      .                     .\nPLEKHN1                     .                     .\nPERM1                       .                     .\n\n\nBy printing the first 5 features and cells in our object (for easier visualization). We can see that we are working with whole numbers which reinforces the idea that this is the raw data, with no tranformations having been applied.\n\n\nOur count matrices function as any other matrix does, with rows and columns.\nIn Seurat, the rows correspond to Features. In the case of spatial transcriptomics, our features are genes. In other experiments, features could refer to chromatin peaks or protein. Since our features are not always genes, we will see the term Feature appear in Seurat function later. The important thing to recall is that in this Visium HD dataset, we are quantifying RNA expression (genes).\nWe can see what the first few genes in our count matrix are:\n\nFeatures(crc) %&gt;% head()\n\n[1] \"SAMD11\"  \"NOC2L\"   \"KLHL17\"  \"PLEKHN1\" \"PERM1\"   \"HES4\"   \n\n\nAs well as see the number of genes that are found in each of our assays:\n\nnrow(crc[[\"Spatial.008um\"]])\n\n[1] 18085\n\nnrow(crc[[\"Spatial.016um\"]])\n\n[1] 18085\n\n\nIn Seurat, the rows correspond to Cells (or samples as it appears in the callout).\nWe can see what the first few cells in our count matrix are:\n\nCells(crc) %&gt;% head()\n\n[1] \"s_016um_00052_00082-1\" \"s_016um_00396_00063-1\" \"s_016um_00297_00147-1\"\n[4] \"s_016um_00347_00254-1\" \"s_016um_00299_00088-1\" \"s_016um_00050_00315-1\"\n\n\nAs well as see the number of cells that are found in each of our assays:\n\nncol(crc[[\"Spatial.008um\"]])\n\n[1] 541968\n\nncol(crc[[\"Spatial.016um\"]])\n\n[1] 136035\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBin size\n\n\n\nDid you notice that the number of cells is different between our 8um and 16um bins?\nThis is why the bin value matters, it determines how many “cells” are ultimately generated. Where a smaller bin size results in more spots.\n\n\n\n\nWe do not just have expression data associated with our sample, we also have the spatial slide that comes with its own set of values and information.\nFor example we can grab the x,y coordinates of each spot using the GetTissueCoordinates() function.\n\nGetTissueCoordinates(crc) %&gt;% head()\n\n                             x        y                  cell\ns_016um_00052_00082-1 60930.62 49099.34 s_016um_00052_00082-1\ns_016um_00396_00063-1 40823.45 48072.16 s_016um_00396_00063-1\ns_016um_00297_00147-1 46628.74 52957.09 s_016um_00297_00147-1\ns_016um_00347_00254-1 43732.54 59222.16 s_016um_00347_00254-1\ns_016um_00299_00088-1 46497.72 49509.67 s_016um_00299_00088-1\ns_016um_00050_00315-1 61103.62 62715.76 s_016um_00050_00315-1\n\n\nOr visualize what our slide looks like:\n\nSpatialDimPlot(crc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeurat automatically creates some metadata for each of the cells when the object is created.
