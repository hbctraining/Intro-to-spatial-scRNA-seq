ADD DESCRIPTION HERE STILL Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the Introduction to R workshop.\nNote for Trainers: Please note that the schedule linked below assumes that learners will spend between 3-4 hours on reading through, and completing exercises from selected lessons between classes. The online component of the workshop focuses on more exercises and discussion/Q & A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nLO 1\nLO 2\nLO 3\nLO 4\n\n\n\nLessons\n\nWorkshop schedule (trainer-led learning)\nSelf-learning\n\n\n\nInstallation Requirements\n\nApplications\nDownload the most recent versions of R and RStudio for your laptop:\n\nR (version 4.0.0 or above)\nRStudio\n\n\n\nPackages for R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nNote 1: Install the packages in the order listed below.\nNote 2: All the package names listed below are case sensitive!\nNote 3: If you have a Mac with an M1 chip, download and install this tool before intalling your packages: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg\nNote 4: At any point (especially if you’ve used R/Bioconductor in the past), in the console R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:. If you see this, type “a” at the prompt and hit Enter to update any old packages. Updating packages can sometimes take quite a bit of time to run, so please account for that before you start with these installations.\nNote 5: If you see a message in your console along the lines of “binary version available but the source version is later”, followed by a question, “Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? y/n”, type n for no, and hit enter.\n\n\n(1) Install the X packages listed below from Bioconductor using the the BiocManager::install() function.\n\npackage_1\npackage_2\npackage_3\npackage_4\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\nBiocManager::install(\"package_1\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_2\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_3\")\nBiocManager::install(\"package_4\")\n\n(2) Install the Y packages listed below from CRAN using the install.packages() function.\n\npackage_5\npackage_6\npackage_7\npackage_8\npackage_9\npackage_10\npackage_11\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\ninstall.packages(\"package_5\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_6\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_7\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_8\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_9\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_10\")\ninstall.packages(\"package_11\")\n\n(3) Finally, please check that all the packages were installed successfully by loading them one at a time using the library() function.\n\nlibrary(package_1)\nlibrary(package_2)\nlibrary(package_3)\nlibrary(package_4)\nlibrary(package_5)\nlibrary(package_6)\nlibrary(package_7)\nlibrary(package_8)\nlibrary(package_9)\nlibrary(package_10)\nlibrary(package_11)\n\n(4) Once all packages have been loaded, run sessionInfo().\n\nsessionInfo()\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nTo cite material from this course in your publications, please use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nCreate Zenodo citation\n\n\nA lot of time and effort went into the preparation of these materials. Citations help us understand the needs of the community, gain recognition for our work, and attract further funding to support our teaching activities. Thank you for citing this material if it helped you in your data analysis."

Find the center of the data\nWe can find the center of the data by taking the average gene expression across each gene (dimension).\n\n# Determine the center of the data by:\n# Finding the average expression of gene A\nGene_A_mean &lt;- mean(expression_tibble$Gene_A)\n# Finding the average expression of gene B\nGene_B_mean &lt;- mean(expression_tibble$Gene_B)\n\n# Create a vector to hold the center of the data\ncenter_of_data &lt;- c(Gene_A_mean, Gene_B_mean)\n# Assign names to the components of the vector\nnames(center_of_data) &lt;- c(\"Gene_A\", \"Gene_B\")\n# Print out the center_of_data vector\ncenter_of_data\n\nGene_A Gene_B \n 25.00  27.25 \n\n\nThe new center of the data will be where ( 25, 27.25 ) is currently. We can visualize this center and inspect that this is does in fact appear to be roughly in the middle of the data.\n\n# View where the center of the data is located\nggplot(expression_tibble, aes(x = Gene_A, y = Gene_B, label = cells)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n    annotate(\"point\", x = Gene_A_mean, y = Gene_B_mean, color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = Gene_A_mean, y = Gene_B_mean, color = \"red\", label=\"New Center\", hjust = 0, vjust = -1) +\n  xlim(0, 80) +\n  ylim(0, 80) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Gene A\") +\n  ylab(\"Gene B\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Example Expression Values from Four Cells\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Translate the points from their raw expression coordinates to coordinates centered around the center of the data\nNext, we need to shift the points so that the center of the data corresponds to the origin. We can do this by subtracting the mean value from each gene from the raw values.\n\n# Shift the data points so that they data is centered on the origin\nrecentered_expression_tibble &lt;- expression_tibble %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Gene_A = Gene_A - Gene_A_mean,\n    Gene_B = Gene_B - Gene_B_mean\n  )\n\n# Print out the re-centered data\nrecentered_expression_tibble\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  cells  Gene_A Gene_B\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Cell_1    -25 -23.2 \n2 Cell_2    -13   2.75\n3 Cell_3     40  29.8 \n4 Cell_4     -2  -9.25\n\n\nAs with any data analysis, it is always a good idea to visualize your data to ensure that it appears to behaving how you intended.

This is because eigenvectors are only defined “up to sign”. This means for a given eigenvalue, the eigenvector v1 and -v1 are the same line, but point in different directions. This does not impact our principal components calculations. However, it could mean that a plot derived v1 will look rotated 180° when compared to a plot derived from -v1. Regardless, it looks like we have the same eigenvectors in both approaches.",
